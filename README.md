- **Pagination:** Pages are automatically created according to how many breeds are found and you can navigate through them with a click.

- **Search by name:** Making use of a redux state and an unbounced local state, the dogs are filtered by breed name 200ms after a change in the search bar is made or when the search button is clicked.

- **Filtering and sorting:** You can filter by temper or origin (whether they are from The Dogs API or created by users) and sort by name or weight. You can even use all the filters and sorters at the same time. -->
